# Introduction:
An air ambulance is a specially outfitted helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft that transports injured or sick people in a medical emergency or over distances or terrain impractical for a conventional ground ambulance. Helicopters can be used for air transportation during emergency to move patients to healthcare facilities from the scene of an emergency. The objective of the project is to understand how weather conditions affect a helicopter’s performance and recommend the best suited helicopter for a healthcare facility or a given rescue scenario. 

# Scenarios:
Given the weather conditions, the range of the helicopter and the maximum speed the helicopter can traverse at, we are considering the following scenarios:
1. If a buyer(hospital) wants to buy a helicopter, the system can help in recommending the best model of the helicopter to buy given their requirements.
2. In an emergency situation, given a hospital has different types of helicopters, the system will recommend the optimal performing one.

# Hypotheses:
1. Given certain weather conditions, the fastest helicopter will always be the optimal performing one.
2. Higher occupancy helicopters are always better than lower occupancy helicopters.

# Limitations and Future Work:
Our system considers only the weather condition, altitude, number of people and x while recommending the optimal performing helicopter.
Certain helicopter parameters like the climb rate or the horse power of the helicopter, is not being taken into consideration while suggesting the optimal performing helicopter.
The system is designed to respond to one emergency situation and does not cater to multiple emergency requests.
The system can be an useful implementation for recommending the air ambulance best suited for a hospital by including more factors which would affect the performance of the helicopter.
